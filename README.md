# Frank

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Frank is a prototype for a top-down action hack-and-slash rogue-lite game developed as part of our university thesis. This prototype implements placeholder functionality for the combat system, a tutorial level, a main level with 2 types of enemies, a wave spawning system, and finally main menu functionality.
